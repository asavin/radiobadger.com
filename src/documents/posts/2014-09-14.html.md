Not only iTunes, but any podcast client should now be able to subscribe to our podcasting feed of new episodes. Here is how:

* In iTunes go to File -> Subscribe to Podcast
* Enter this address: http://radiobadger.com/podcast-feed.xml
* Enjoy fresh episodes of the Badger Radio

So, from now on we have two RSS feeds:
* Blogposts feed: [http://radiobadger.com/feed.xml](http://radiobadger.com/feed.xml)
* Podcast episodes feed: [http://radiobadger.com/podcast-feed.xml](http://radiobadger.com/podcast-feed.xml)

Meanwhile, Radio Badger podcast is submitted to the iTunes podcasts directory and currently under review. Fingers crossed!
